# Example dynamic heatmap

This repository illustrates an example of how to create your own heatmap.

Read my accompanying [blog post](https://medium.com/@jgefroh/how-to-design-software-dynamic-heatmaps-e864742941b0) for a step-by-step walkthrough of this repository.

`map.js` is the vanilla javascript version of the heatmap.
`map.vue` is an example of the heatmap as it could look like as a Vue component.
